    have a phase-slope across the band (i.e. a delay). This phase-slope first
    needs to be 'unwrapped' in order to correctly identify outliers reliably.

    Internally this function constructs an initial model of the unknown phase-slope.
    It estimates this by looking at the bulk set of gradients on a channel-to-channel
    basis, and looking at the builk distribution after removing large jumps (possibly
    RFI, possible a wrap). The initial phase offset is taken as the phase of the first
    valid gain.

    The initial model is used to unwrap the data, allowing a lest-squares fitter to
    more reliably fit. Once the fitter has been executed, the final cuts are applied
    against the unwrapped phase residuals.

    Experience shows that best results are achieved when the input complex-gains
    have been normalised against a reference antenna. There may be complex structures
    when the raw antenna phase vs frequency plots that can not be reliably fit for
    in this manner. These structures (I believe) arise from the beam-wise spectral
