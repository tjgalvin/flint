"""Simple interface into wsclean

Some notes around the file naming.

A certain filenaming scheme is required for FITS files to perform leakage correction
when co-adding them together in the yandasoft linmos application. The stokes field
needs to be encoded as ``.i.``. For example:

    >>> `SB1234.RACS_0123+43.beam01.i.image.fits`

The wsclean formatted output string appends something denoted with ``-``. Within
this code there is and attempt to rename the wsclean outputs to replace the ``-``
with a ``.``.
